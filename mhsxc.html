	   <p class="whatsnewp">Summer Training</p>
	   <p>Summer Training is very important to success in the actual season.
	      During the summer there will be captain's practices and fun runs led
		  by the team captains. The tentative schedule is as follows:</p>
	   <ul>
	     <li>Mondays at 5:30 PM</li>
		 <li>Wednesdays at 5:30 PM</li>
		 <li>Fridays at 8:00 AM</li>
	   </ul>
	   <p>Monday and Wednesday practices will meet at the concession stand at 
	      Fred Green field and Friday practices will meet either at the Pine Banks
		  track or at the concession stand for a hill workout.<br><br>
		  Summer training can make or break your season, so try your best to make as
		  many as you can so we can have a great season!</p>

	   <p class="whatsnewp">Camp</p>
	   <p>Are you interested in getting more involved in Cross Country?
	      Do you want to have a fun-filled summer training experience?
		  If so, you should consider coming to Northeast Kingdom Running Camp this summer.
		  NKRC is a running camp in upstate Vermont that some Melrose teammates already
		  attend. It is a great way to get better over the summer and meet new people who share
		  a passion for the sport. If you have any questions, you can ask Jerry Murphy, Gavin Rowe or
		  Jack Summersby for details, or you can visit the <a class="links" href="http://nkrc.camp" target="_blank">NKRC website.</a>
