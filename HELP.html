<!-- Theres one thing that i would like to add to my website that is currently beyond my knowledge
of how to do it. I would like a feature in my website where i can update a ceertain part of the homepage
without going into the HTML files and updating it like that. For example, I would basically like to be able
to do the same thing that the aspen dash on the LC TV has where a google form is filled out and an announcement 
added. 

more specifically, i currently have a box on the homepage called "whats new", which is what i would like
to be updated from a google form or something else otherwise similar. the idea is that if i am at home without
access to HTML files or would like to make a quick update without manually updating everything, i can simply fill
out a google form to update this box on the homepage.

i do not know how to do this on my own. My skills are limited to a decent understanding of HTML and CSS and some of
the basics of javascript. if you can help me please do. -->
